      CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for example, for
      changing the color and size of headings and links. It can be used to
      create a layout — for example, turning a single column of text into a
      layout with a main content area and a sidebar for related information.CSS
      (Cascading Style Sheets) was first proposed by Håkon Wium Lie on October
      10, 1994 while working with Tim Berners-Lee at CERN and the rest is
      history. CSS was not the only styling language in development at the time,
      but the very element of cascading and developing sequence is what set it
      apart from the rest.
